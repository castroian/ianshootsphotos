## Welcome to my photography portfolio!

# About me
This page is mostly placeholder until I can figure out how to make a better website. If you're interested in viewing more of my photos, I mostly post my work on Instagram at [@ianshootsphotos](https://instagram.com/ianshootsphotos). You can learn more about me on the main page [here](https://castroian.github.io/).

I mostly shoot street and event photography (concerts and protests) with a Fujifilm XE-3 and Pentax K1000. I'm still learning, so contact me if you need a photographer at your event! You can DM me on Instagram or email me at castro.ian(at)berkeley.edu.
