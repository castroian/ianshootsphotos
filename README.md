# Welcome to my photography portfolio!

### About me
This page is a placeholder until I can figure out how to make a better website. If you're interested in viewing more of my photos, I post most of my work on Instagram at [@ianshootsphotos](https://instagram.com/ianshootsphotos). You can learn more about me on this site's main page [here](https://castroian.github.io/).

I mostly shoot street photography and events (concerts and protests) with a Fujifilm XE-3 and Pentax K1000. I'm still learning, so contact me if you need a photographer at your event! I'm Bay Area based. You can DM me on Instagram or email me at [castro.ian(at)berkeley.edu](mailto:castro.ian@berkeley.edu).
